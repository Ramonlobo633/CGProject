# CGProject
Computer graphics project with C ++ using QT Creator

Representation of objects in a 3d plane, with the projection of shadows, orthographic projections, perspective projections,
selection system with mouse, transformations applied to objects and cameras and definition of extra camera session


Commands:

-manipulation of objects 
'a'-> to active/deactivate the add new object mode
'3'-> when 'a' is active you can add a new Personagem to a vector of objects
'4'-> when 'a' is active you can add a new Cadeira to a vector of objects
'5'-> when 'a' is active you can add a new Mesa to a vector of objects
'6'-> when 'a' is active you can add a new Notebook to a vector of objects
'7'-> when 'a' is active you can add a new Book to a vector of objects
'8'-> when 'a' is active you can add a new Board to a vector of objects
',' and '.' -> iterate between objects, selecting objetcs
backspace -> delete the last object insert
'r' -> remove the select object
'0' -> to active/deactivate the selection object by mouse click mode
't' -> to active/deactivate the transformation(rotation, translation and scale) of selected objects using mouse mode
'n'-> to active/deactivate the projections(Ortho and Pers) of objects mode
'N'-> when 'n' is active you can iterate between orthographic projections and perspective projections of an objects

-manupulation of scenery
's'-> to active/deactivate the shadow projection of objects mode
'p'-> when 's' is active you can iterate between pontual light and distant light 
'G'-> to active/deactivate the Ground mode
'g'-> to active/deactivate the grid mode
'c'-> iterate between position of cameras
'l'-> to active/deactivate the transformation of light point by mouse mode
